The entrepreneur does not want to simply open up the pet store by looking at neighborhoods that currently have a high number of existing pet stores as the supply in those existing neighborhoods may exceed current demands.  Therefore, the goal is to identify neighborhoods that have characteristics that are suitable for pet stores but currently is undersupplied.  They believe that the best indicators for identifying the location are the type of venues that are situated in a particular neighborhood.  In particular, it is assumed that the types of venues in a particular neighborhood act as a proxy to represent the local demographic, including their needs and interests.  In this project, we will determine which type of venues are often established in conjunction with pet stores.  Once we understand what the top type of venues are, we will proceed to locate neighborhoods that have these venues as potential targets for the new pet store.  </p>",
